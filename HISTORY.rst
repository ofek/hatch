^^^^^^

0.18.0
^^^^^^

- ``release`` now allows the use of custom repositories!

  env. This behavior can be disabled with the new ``-nd/--no-detect`` flag.

0.17.1
^^^^^^

- Handle `<https://bugs.python.org/issue22490>`_

0.17.0
^^^^^^

- Hatch now guarantees Windows support via AppVeyor!
- No project detection will occur if a virtual env is active.

0.16.0
^^^^^^

- Virtual envs created with ``env``, ``new``, ``init``, and ``shell`` commands can
  now access the system site-packages with the ``-g/--global-packages`` flag!
- Improved ``setup.py`` generation.

0.15.0
^^^^^^

- ``use`` renamed to ``shell``, though it will remain as an alias!
- ``new``/``init`` commands now only emit a warning when there is no config file.
- You can now specify what Python to use when creating a virtual env
  in the ``new``/``init`` command.
- **Fix:** ``use`` no longer requires the env name argument to be ``.`` when
  targeting a project's dedicated virtual env.

0.14.0
^^^^^^

- ``new``/``init`` commands now create a dedicated virtual env for the project.
  This can be disabled with the new ``-ne/--no-env`` flag.

  env in the ``use`` command.
